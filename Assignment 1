Problem
As a developer, you are asked to write the Java code for a simple file system. 
The file system should be able to handle folders and files. 
Each folder can contain files of different types as well as other folders. 
Your solution should be able to handle any composition of folders and files.
There are a number of operations that need to be implemented on the file system:
•	size(): returns the overall size (e.g. in bytes) of the files and sub-folders contained in any one folder
•	numFiles(): returns the number of files in any folder, including those in its sub-folders
•	numFolders(): returns the number of sub-folders in any folder
