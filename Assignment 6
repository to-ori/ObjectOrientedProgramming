In this lab session, you are going to implement the functionality of a simple weather app using ideas from the observer design pattern.
The app has a three display widgets:  

StatisticsDisplay:  displays the max, min and mean for the values of the weather data source it is observing
CurrentConditionsDisplay: simply displays the current weather values of the weather data  source it is observing
ForecastDisplay: displays a forecast using the following rules: if the pressure has increased since the last data: "sunshine"; if is has stayed the same: "no change"; if the pressure has dropped: " rain"
The app has four sources of weather data : WeatherData_North, WeatherData_South, WeatherData_East, WeatherData_West.

At any time, a display widget is observing one weather data source and providing display output based on the data received by that source.

Your mission is to implement this functionality and demonstrate how you can register any weather data source with a  display widget, pass new data to the data source and then observe changes in the display widget.
